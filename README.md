# etch_a_sketch
This project is a web version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch.

DOM manipulation skills attained through the project course will be used to highlight what was learned.

Similar to previous course projects, this will be a skeletal structure for the assignment and will be revisited for further improvements on both the code and UI.
